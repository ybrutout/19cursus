I've got a big pot of hummus and I'm doing alright
Mama said she loves me, it's a lonely ol' life
And most of my dreams, they never get to the light
But nothing's gonna break my day

I got a big pot of hummus and I'm doing good
Another day ended like I knew that it would
There's a funny kinda feeling in my neighborhood
But nothin's gonna break my day

So take a carrot, and then the celery, dip it in
Oh the memory, break the bread
Love your enemy and if you cannot find a bridge
Just think about your fridge and remember that you've got a
Big pot of hummus
Big pot of hummus
Big pot of hummus (ooh-ooh-ooh-mas)

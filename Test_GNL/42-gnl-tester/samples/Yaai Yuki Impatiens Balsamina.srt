0
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,800
The plug on my headphones remains barren.

1
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:35,600
Anyway, for now, I want to isolate myself from this world.

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,700
From time to time, there's the sound of the wind. I close my eyes. Darkness.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,800
No one comes interfere, in my own little area.

4
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:02,800
"There's no way I'm actually bluffing, right?,"

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,700
I tell myself, I tell myself.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
How far will I walk?

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,400
"I'm lonely"? I wouldn't say that even if you pried off my lips.

8
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,400
Because, because,

9
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,800
if they think of me as "that poor thing," It'd be shameful

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,700
"I bet they hate you, huh?"

11
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,500
Not so, I just like being alone.

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Because, because,

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,000
if I don't pretend I do,

14
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:51,600
it means I'm already broken.

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,540
"Don't touch me." the balsam, fallen silent.

16
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:18,600
And yet it can't leave seeds unless it breaks it's shell

17
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:30,600
Everyone looks merry, while I'm the only one outside the circle

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,800
If i'd been in from the start, i wonder if that'd have made a difference

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,900
Rather than wandering around, not a part of anything

20
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,800
standing boldly independent

21
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,660
looks a lot cooler, doesn't it?

22
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:02,500
"Let me into your group?" I wouldn't say that even if you pried off my lips

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Because, because,

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,900
my pride won't allow that.

25
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I don't think, "I envy them." I don't want to.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
Then, I may as well-

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't want any friends,

28
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:35,000
just give me a heart that won't break.

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,900
You can't even go to the bathroom by yourself,

30
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,800
I cursed them,

31
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,700
as I followed them out of the corner of my eye.

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,500
"I'm lonely?" I wouldn't say that even if you pried my lips off

33
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
Because, because,

34
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,900
if they think of me as "that poor thing," I'll be the loser

35
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,700
"I bet they hate you, huh?"

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,800
No, I just like being alone.

37
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,800
Because, because,

38
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,800
If I don't pretend that I do,

39
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:51,000
it means I'm already broken

40
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,800

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,080
Can you see it? The tears in these eyes

1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,800
are blurring into the colours of my life.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,120
What have I left to give you?

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,760
I ask the question, I cease to function...

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,700
Blue, red and white mix

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,380
I am shouting in this world.

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,620
What am I seeking out?

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm tired of chasing...

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,800
How much am I abnormal?

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,500
Am I broken?

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm broken all right.

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,040
Even so, I want, I want to breathe.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,400
Can you see me,

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,320
like I'm in a dream? Even my final

14
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,660
word is stuck!

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,700
It happened a long time ago.

16
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,200
A faint light is flooding the sky

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,380
What did I choose and line up?

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,020
Colours of tears are overlaid.

19
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,200
That floating body

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,500
dissolves and blurs inside my consciousness

21
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,780
What did I come to see and compare?

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm sad and I forget...

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,040
How much am I abnormal?

24
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,740
Am I distorted?

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm distorted all right

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:04,340
Even so, I want, I want to breathe

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,620
I'm having a dream

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,620
To you who are in my thoughts, even my final

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,760
word to you is stuck!

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,620
Translation: ElectricRaichu

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,660
Can I neither give, lose, or forget?

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,060
This error that's going beserk,

33
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,940
I kill it and laugh, and again, an error.

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,320
Did I break it?

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you know it's broken?

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,880
Even so, my tears hurt, they hurt.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,200
Have they reached you?

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,140
Even though my final words

39
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,700
are lined up in my singing voice,

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,600
the overlapping colours blur...

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,180
Am I broken?

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm broken all right

43
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:30,700
Even so, I want, I want to breathe.

44
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,040
You've seen me,

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,980
like I was in a dream. Even my final

46
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,280
word is stuck!

0
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,840
What seems to be endless

1
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,380
Pointless colorless

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,140
It's a mess, you know

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,220
This hopeless life of mine

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,920
No friends to be with

5
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,800
I'm really so jealous of all the beautiful colors of yours

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,620
Heavy shadows, scary nightfall erase all the lines I've got

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,740
I want to scream but can't open my mouth

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,640
A broken piece of chalk is enough to connect the dots

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,300
Because I'm still alive

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,660
There must be a meaning, right?

11
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,900
People in this world are colorful

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
The ugly and the beautiful

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,740
Make up colors in this world

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,560
Hey

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,040
Just pick up your pencil, crayons

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,920
And be colorful

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,340
I'm sure this world is wonderful

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,520
Showered in happiness

19
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,860
My blossoming friendship

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,420
It's a bless, I know

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,940
Your kindness led my way

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
'Cause of my wariness

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,100
I was so blinded from all the unusual colors of mine

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,440
To think that I was so scared over nothing at all

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,000
I guess I was too young to know myself

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,820
In the future even if my lines are all tangled up

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,880
I'll still be alive

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,900
And that's what matters, right?

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,440
People in this world are incredible

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,340
So strong and so admirable

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,120
Each one is a miracle

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,980
Hey

33
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,500
Just pick up your pencil, crayons

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,340
And stay colorful

35
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,900
You see? This world is wonderful

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,440
Even though I may not be able to erase all my mistakes

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,220
I can paint on another page

38
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,820
Because everyone around you have always lived that way

39
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
There's so much to your life

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,420
Everything will be all right

41
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:34,340
People, people in this world are colorful

42
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,220
The ugly and the beautiful

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,160
Make up colors in this world

44
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,040
Hey

45
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,260
Just pick up your pencil, crayons

46
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,440
And be colorful

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,620
Because this world is wonderful

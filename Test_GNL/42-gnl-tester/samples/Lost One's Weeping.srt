0
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,820
A blade's edge with centimeters of suspicion

1
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,860
Stabbing a vein at the end of it all

2
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,580
Sticky love spurts out

3
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,920
Even my Les Paul became a deadly weapon

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,520
It's no-fiction

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,540
I like math and science

6
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,500
But I was never one for Japanese

7
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,440
I'd worry about which answer was right

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,360
Jokes on me, both were wrong

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
Today's homework is my basic self

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,280
With just enough  with no complaints Living in the nowadays

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,380
But why do we sometimes-- no, always

12
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,260
Say we're sad, say we're lonely

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,040
Can you read the kanji on the board?

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,120
Can you read the shape of this kid's heart?

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,880
Who stained that heart black?

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,180
Who was it? Who was it!?

17
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,360
Can you do this problem on an abacus?

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,060
Can you undo this collar around this kid's neck?

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,040
Can we keep going like this?

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,660
What're you gonna do?

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,300
I don't care anymore!

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,560
All this time we were

23
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,580
Under a crude hyponosis

24
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,080
Holding an incredible arrogrance

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,620
Hidden inside

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,600
Can't do yesterday's homework as always

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,460
With just enough  with no complaints Living in the nowadays

28
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,560
But why does this lump in our hearts

29
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,040
Say we want to disappear?

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,520
Say we want to die?

31
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,580
Can you read the kanji on the board?

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,440
Can you read the shape of this kid's heart?

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,260
Who stained that heart black?

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,380
Hey! Who was it? Who was it!?

35
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,220
Can you do this problem on an abacus?

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,100
Can you undo this collar on this kid's neck?

37
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,180
Can we keep going like this?

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,700
What're you gonna do?

39
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,120
What're you gonna do?

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,160
Do you remember the formula for area ratio?

41
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,860
Do you remember the dreams of your childhood?

42
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,080
Who threw those dreams in a ditch?

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,480
Who was it!?

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
You know who it was!

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
When are you gonna grow up?

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,640
What is a grown-up anyway?

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,680
Who has the answers?

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
What're you gonna do?

49
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,040
What're you gonna do?

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,760
Can you read the kanji on the board?

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,660
Can you read the shape of this kid's heart?

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,660
Who stained that heart black?

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,360
Who was it? Who was it!?

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,580
Can you do this problem on an abacus?

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,560
Can you undo this collar on this kid's neck?

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Can we keep going like this?

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,060
What're you gonna do?

58
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,640
I don't care anymore!
